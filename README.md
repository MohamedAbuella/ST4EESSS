Spatio-Temporal Aggregation of Onboard Vessel and External Weather Data to Improve Energy Efficiency in Short-Sea Shipping

### Python code to data preprocessing and visualization

This notebook the data preprocessing and vaisulaization

The route sections (All, North, Middle, South, direct) can be selected by modifying the value of the following flag switch (nth_mid_sth_fg)

The inputs combination (0, 1, 2, 3) can be selected by modifying the value of the following flag switch (inp_idx)

This notebook is reproducible, the user just needs to chang the user_name in first cell, then the rest will automatically be created, such as folders and subfolders where figure and excel files are saved.


### Python code to estimate the Eff-score using ANN regression model


This notebook to present the results of the ANN regression with different combinations of inputs (i.e., 0,1,2,3) and ANN structure parameters (i.e., number of layers and number of neurons).

The inpout combinations and the ANN structure parameters can be modified

The route sections (All, North, Middle, South, direct) can be selected by modifying the value of the following flag switch (nth_mid_sth_fg) 

The inputs combination (0, 1, 2, 3) can be selected by modifying the value of the following flag switch (inp_idx) 

The ANN structure parameters are number of layer and eurons, while ANN training paramters are activation function, epochs. batch size, learning rate, data standardization.

This notebook is reproducible,  the user just needs to chang the user_name in first cell, then the rest will automatically be created, such as folders and subfolders where figure and excel files are saved.

### Heat map for the searching results of ANN regression with different inputs combinations and ANN structure

This notebook to present the results of the ANN searching with different combinations of inputs (i.e., 0,1,2,3) and ANN structure parameters (i.e., number of layers and number of neurons).

The route sections (All, North, Middle, South, Direct) can be selected by modifying the value of the following flag switch (nth_mid_sth_fg)
